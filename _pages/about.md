Hiya! I'm a PhD student in computational astrophysics studying how galaxies form and evolve, with a particular interest on the role of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in this.

My research seeks to understand the formation and evolution of SMBHs, as well as the interplay (or coevolution) between them and their host galaxies. In particular, I look at the physical mechanisms driving this coevolution, including AGN feedback, mergers, cosmological environment, all of which lead to the diversity in the galaxy population that we observe.

To tackle this subject I use various types of numerical models / simulations, including semi-empirical models and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.

I am a member of the [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid), [LSST](https://www.lsst.org/about), [SKA](https://www.skao.int/en), [NewAthena](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/athena), and [LISA](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/LISA) science collaborations.
